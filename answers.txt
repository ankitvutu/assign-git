Q1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file specifies the types of files that Git should ignore in your repository.
For a Java project, it should include files that are either generated by the run-time environment or contain environment specific information.


Q2) What does fast-forward in Git mean?
In Git, to "fast forward" means to update the HEAD pointer in such a way that its new value is a direct descendant of the prior value. 
This is a simplification technique used by git when there is no divergent work to merge together.


Q3) Why should you have different branches?
Having different branches makes it easier to perform changes on the code (add a feature or fix a bug) without having unstable code merged with the main code base.

 
Q4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Projects usually have only one repository. However, sometimes large and complex projects span across multiple repositories, one for each service.
